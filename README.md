# kvarkDB

This is mainly inspired from [tidesdb](https://github.com/tidesdb/tidesdb)
But i'll try to add some experimental ideas.

Goals:

[] Use LSM based storage engine
[] Write a minimal key-value db
[] Support REPL


Features:

[] WAL
[] LSM Based with levelled compaction
[] Transaction support
